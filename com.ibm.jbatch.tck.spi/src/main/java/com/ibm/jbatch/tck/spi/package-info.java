/**
 * The "porting package" SPI defined purely for the purpose of executing the
 * TCK (which the typical implementation will NOT need to implement).
 * <p>
 * This provides a way for the TCK to determine test execution results
 * in a more convenient manner than if we had to only rely on the Jakarta Batch
 * specification-defined APIs.
 *
 * <p>
 * The TCK itself ships with a default implementation of this SPI (using polling).
 * The expectation therefore is that the typical Jakarta Batch implementation will not need
 * to implement this SPI, but will use the default implementation.
 *
 * <p>
 * For more details, see the documentation in the Jakarta Batch TCK Reference Guide, included within the TCK binary.
 *
 * @see <a href="https://download.eclipse.org/jakartabatch/tck/eftl/jakarta.batch.official.tck-1.0.2.zip">TCK binary</a>
